# Multiplayer Snake Game in Java: Concurrency and Remote Player Support

A distributed and concurrent version of the classic **Snake** game, developed in **Java**. Snakes are autonomously controlled, competing for prizes on a shared board. Emphasizes **concurrency**, **coordination**, and **network programming** for remote gameplay.

## 📋 Project Overview
- Console-based or GUI-enhanced **Java** game
- Inspired by the classic **Snake** game
- Focused on **distributed systems** and **concurrent programming**

## 🔍 Key Features
- Autonomous snake behavior with concurrent execution
- Competing snakes race to collect prizes on a shared board
- Synchronized movement and collision handling
- Multiplayer support through network programming (Phase 2)
- Real-time game updates across remote clients

## 💡 Additional Functionalities
- Visual or textual board representation
- Prize generation and point tracking
- Player-specific logic abstraction for AI or remote control

## 🧪 Development & Methodology
- Built in **Java**, utilizing **threads** and **sockets**
- Emphasis on **synchronization**, **thread safety**, and **event-driven design**
- Modular design to support future enhancements (e.g., real players)
- Collaborative version control with **Git**
